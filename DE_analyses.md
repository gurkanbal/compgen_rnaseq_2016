A differential analysis, depending on the overall goals, may proceed with the following steps:

1. It is suggested to organize your files in a nice way.  The following is just one possibility, where the R scripts of downstream analysis are kept in the `analysis` directory and the `data` directory contains a set of directories for the relevant data (`anno` for annotation information, `FASTQ` for the raw FASTQ sequence files, `indices` for the indices that the tools need).  You do not necessarily need to follow this exactly, but a system like this is helpful to stay organized.
